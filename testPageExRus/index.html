          <p>
            A Coding Champion is a parent who, like us, believes that learning
            to code should be an essential part of every child’s development.
            They believe technology is the future. They believe that it’s our
            responsibility to provide opportunities for our kids to develop the
            skills they’ll need in an environment built for learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Coding Champion is an advocate for bringing coding programs into
            schools so more kids can be exposed to computer programming,
            robotics, and technology education.

          <p>
            At CodeAdvantage we are, first and foremost, parents just like you.
            We believe that all kids should have access to coding programs from

            With help from parents who share our passion, we’ve been able to
            teach STEM programs to thousands of children by being asked to bring
            our programs into top public schools, private schools, and
            after-school programs in the NYC/NJ metro area.
          </p>
          <p>
